### Description of the project (2-3+ sentences):
Notion came about privacy and password concept introduced to protect privacy. A "word" that is known to user only and one who know that "word" only can access the subject matter. Later computer technology grown up and "word" became easy to guess since nature of the user to keep word simple and easy to remember. Next phase came to make complicated the word so, not so easy to guess replacing number with character and combination of uppercase and lowercase. However, that make password easy to forgot. Now concept changed from pass"word" to pass"phrase", were instead of having one word, password made of bunch of words having number and special characters. This project, xkcd Password Generator, about generating such password.

Following workflow was considered in this project:

* Project has main two php files:

      1) index.php   
      2) logic.php

* index.php controlls display of the page, where logic for password generator resides to logic.php
* A word list created with 58000 words from reference: ["http://www.mieliestronk.com"] (http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt)
* Wordlist was fatched and stored to an array
* Based on user requirement, number of words randomly selected and a password is created.
* Special character or number can be added to password as well
* Comments were added to logic.php in order to understand code more clearly.
